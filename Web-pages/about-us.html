        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h3>Knight and Nerdy</h3>
        <p>
            Established in 2009, the East Ridge High School Knight and Nerdy Robotics team has held steadfast amongst its peers in the FIRST Robotics Competition. First Sponsored by Rick Croteau, it has shifted to Justin King as the head teacher of the team. The team has been working hard in the past 7 years to have an impact not only on FIRST, but on it’s community as well.
          </p>
          <p>
	The primary goal of Knight and Nerdy is to get students interested in STEM, which is the collection of fields; Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. It does this in many ways, from teaching how to use mechanical systems and electrical components to participating in FIRST Robotics Competitions, which encourage students to share ideas and form relationships within and outside the team. Solidworks, a 3D CAD software is used by the team to map out complex mechanical systems that would be too complicated to draw on paper. Programming is taught to new students so that we can utilize the mechanics of the bots in the most efficient way possible. Electrical systems are displayed by how the flow of current can affect mechanical machines such as motors or pneumatic. The teaching of these is to prepare students for the Robotics Competition, and eventually, for their career in the STEM fields.
	Another major goal of team 2797 is to focus our personal on giving back to the community. We volunteer for Sommer Sports, and various other races to keep our voice heard in the Local community in and around Clermont. Otherwise, we assist in helping local elementary and middle schools start and maintain their own robotics teams, to further the reach of STEM in early education. We hope that by spreading the reach of our robotics team, that the community will take more interest in STEM programs, and help spread the importance of STEM into our future Engineers, Scientists, and Mathematicians.
	Altogether, our robotics team aims to focus its goals on creating a fun and educational environment for students to learn about the merits of engineering and science. Overall, we have successfully affected our community, and spread our reach further than we had in past years, and are now growing into something that can have a great effect on the future of our generation.

        <h3>First Robotics</h3>
        <p>
          
        </p>
        <h1>Teams</h1>
        <h3>Mechanical</h3>
        <p>
         The mechanical branch focuses on the physical aspects of the robot, it’s structure, it’s moving parts, and it’s maintenance. Overall, the mechanical team educates new members on the usage of pneumatics, motors, and gearboxes, along with other basic mechanics and tools. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Those members which focus themselves on the mechanical branch will learn the importance of tools, from digital to physical. The mechanical branch utilizes a program called Solidworks to plan out large scale projects, and complicated designs. Solidworks is a 3D Computer Aided Design software which allows it’s users to form complex assemblies with moving parts and test their feasibility in the real world. However, only learning concepts is not the only goal of the mechanical branch. Thus, the mechanical branch also utilizes tools, from screwdrivers and wrenches to bandsaws and drill-presses. The new members are taught the safe way to use these tools, and are then trained to use them for the build season.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mechanical branch is headed by the Mechanical Lead, who focuses on the development of the bot, and has to work together in conjunction with the Electronics Lead. The Mechanical Lead is tasked with guiding new members into the world of motors and struts. They must understand the basics of all of the components of the bot, including the dimensions of those electronics necessary for the functioning of the bot.
        </p>
        <h3>Electrical/Programming</h3>
        <p>
          The electronics Branch is separated into two departments, programming, and it’s namesake, electrical. These departments are closely intertwined, as one cannot function without the other, and they must work together to form the input and output of the robot.
        </p>
        <p>
            The programming department focuses on the development of the coding for the robot. The programming languages have shifted from year to year, from C++, to Java, to C. This is a result of different programmers being comfortable using different languages. However, overall, our team usually falls back to Java coding, as it is among the easiest to learn, and usually runs well at competitions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The electronics department focuses on wiring and the more physical aspects of electronics. This includes the components such as the Robo-Rio, or motor controllers such as Talons. Wire management is an important aspect of electronics, because wires can get in the way of mechanical systems, or waste potentially usable room on the robot. Understanding the importance of soldering correctly, or connecting the correct controllers to their appropriate ports can be the difference between a working robot, and a robot that fries itself. This means that the  electronics branch has to be extremely careful when working both on and off of the robot. Teaching how to use wires and motor controllers correctly are high priority for the electronics department.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Electrical Lead has to maintain the communications between the two departments, understand the basics of electrical systems, and keep up to date on the mechanical systems of the mechanical branch. They must also help teach new members the basic electrical systems, and wiring techniques, along with establishing a community between the electrical and programming departments.
