        <h3>Knight and Nerdy</h3>
        <p>
          The history of role-playing games begins with an earlier tradition of role-playing, which combined with the rulesets of fantasy wargames in the 1970s to give rise to the modern role-playing game.[1] A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which the participants assume the roles of characters and collaboratively create stories. Participants determine the actions of their characters based on their characterization, and the actions succeed or fail according to a system of rules and guidelines. Within the rules, they may improvise freely; their choices shape the direction and outcome of the games.

Role-playing games are substantially different from competitive games such as ball games and card games. This has led to confusion among some non-players about the nature of fantasy gaming. The game Dungeons & Dragons was a subject of controversy in the 1980s when well-publicized opponents claimed it caused negative spiritual and psychological effects. Academic research has discredited these claims.[2] Some educators support role-playing games as a healthy way to hone reading and arithmetic skills.[3] Though role-playing has been accepted by some,[4] a few religious organizations continue to object.[5]

Media attention both increased sales and stigmatized certain games. In thirty years the genre has grown from a few hobbyists and boutique publishers to an economically significant part of the games industry, though grass-roots and small business involvement remains substantial. Games industry company Hasbro purchased fantasy game publisher Wizards of the Coast in 1998 for an estimated $325 million.[6]

        <h3>First Robotics</h3>
        <p>
          FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an international high school robotics competition. Each year, teams of high school students and mentors work during a six-week period to build game-playing robots that weigh up to 120 pounds (54 kg).[5] Robots complete tasks such as scoring balls into goals, flying discs into goals, inner tubes onto racks, hanging on bars, and balancing robots on balance beams. The game changes yearly, keeping the excitement fresh and giving each team a more level playing field. While teams are given a standard set of parts, they are also allowed a budget and encouraged to buy or make specialized parts. FRC is one of four robotics competition programs organized by FIRST.

FRC has a unique culture, built around two values. Gracious Professionalism embraces the competition inherent in the program, but rejects trash talk and chest-thumping, instead embracing empathy and respect for other teams. Coopertition emphasizes that teams can cooperate and compete at the same time.[6] The goal of the program is to inspire students to be science and technology leaders.

In 2016, the 25th year of competition, 3128 teams with roughly 75,000 students and 19,000 mentors from 24 countries built robots. They competed in 53 Regional Competitions, 65 District Qualifying Competitions, and 8 District Championships. 600 teams won slots to attend the FIRST Championship, where they competed in a tournament. In addition to on-field competition, teams and team members competed for awards recognizing entrepreneurship, creativity, engineering, industrial design, safety, controls, media, quality, and exemplifying the core values of the program.

Most teams reside in the United States, with Canada, Israel, and Mexico contributing significant numbers of teams.[2]

          Le coup d'envoi de la saison est programmé le 28 mars 2012 avec une série de deux matchs en deux jours au Tokyo Dome de Tokyo, au Japon, entre les Mariners de Seattle et les Athletics d'Oakland1. En Amérique du Nord, la première partie est disputée le 4 avril alors que le nouveau Marlins Ballpark de Miami est inauguré lors d'un match entre les Marlins de Miami et les Cardinals de Saint-Louis. Miguel Cabrera, premier gagnant de la Triple couronne depuis 1967, est le joueur par excellence de la Ligue américaine et Buster Posey reçoit le même honneur dans la Ligue nationale. L'artiste de la balle papillon R. A. Dickey gagne à 38 ans le trophée Cy Young du meilleur lanceur de la Nationale et David Price reçoit le prix dans l'Américaine. 2012 voit l'émergence du jeune Mike Trout et les débuts de Bryce Harper, tous deux choisis meilleures recrues de leurs ligues respectives. Les Orioles de Baltimore et les Athletics d'Oakland surprennent le baseball en accédant, malgré de sombres pronostics en début d'année, aux séries éliminatoires, les Nationals de Washington gagnent leur premier titre de division et les Tigers de Détroit sont champions de la Ligue américaine avant de perdre en Série mondiale contre les Giants de San Francisco.

          Perhaps this passage seems inappropriate as an opening to a drama in which there are no carefully delineated characters; but even here, Shakespeare could not create human beings without enduing them with life. We have the good-natured, appreciative Theseus, who makes the best of everything; the proud, fastidious Hippolyta; the tall, fair, spiteful, cowardly, exasperated Helena; the petite, sprightly, dark, confiding, outraged Hermia, - brave, but with a will and temper of her own; Lysander, the true gentleman and lover; Demetrius, who was no gentleman, but at once hot-tempered and a sneak.

Just as in newspaper illustrations, a French artist, with half a dozen random scratches of the pen, makes his sketch instinct with life and meaning, so Shakespeare, in his merest sketches, gives the spirit of a finished and elaborated portrait; and nowhere do we see this more plainly than in the "Midsummer Night's Dream." Observe, in contrast, that the fairies, and the clown-fairy, Puck, have no characters at all. Oberon is possessed by the spirit of jealousy; Titania, by a spirit of tormenting; Puck delights in putting his finger into every pie, for frolic's sake, be it to mar or mend; but we do not feel in the least that Oberon is of a jealous disposition, or that Titania is a fairy Cressida, or that Puck is steeped in malignity. Their jealousy, their caprices, or their mischief, are mere surface qualities.

        <h3>Business</h3>
        <p>
                       Many homes around the world have at least one cat living inside as a pet; in fact many homes have a few cats dwelling in them. People raise these animals for many reasons. Some want them for their companionship. Cats are soft, sweet, and lovable. People like playing with them when they are kittens and once they are older and calm love just snuggling with them. The reason these people keep cats is mainly for enjoyment. However, many other people keep cats to control the mouse or insect population in their house or on their farms. These cats usually do not come into much contact with their owners. Most just stay outside or in the barn where the mice are. But the question is where did cats originally come from, who first domesticated them, and who are their first ancestors? I think that all cats from the giant lions of Africa to the small house cat all came from the same ancestor. I will address and hopefully answer these questions and try to shed some light on the subject.
