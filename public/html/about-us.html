        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            Established in 2009, the East Ridge High School Knight and Nerdy Robotics
				team has held steadfast amongst its peers in the FIRST Robotics Competition.
				First Sponsored by Rick Croteau, it has shifted to Justin King as the
				head teacher of the team. The team has been working hard in the past
				7 years to have an impact not only on FIRST, but on it’s community as
				well.
        </p>
			 <p>
				 The primary goal of Knight and Nerdy is to get students interested
				 in STEM, which is the collection of fields; Science, Technology, Engineering
				 and Mathematics. It does this in many ways, from teaching how to use
				 mechanical systems and electrical components to participating in FIRST
				 Robotics Competitions, which encourage students to share ideas and form
				 relationships within and outside the team. Solidworks, a 3D CAD software
				 is used by the team to map out complex mechanical systems that would
				 be too complicated to draw on paper. Programming is taught to new students
				 so that we can utilize the mechanics of the bots in the most efficient
				 way possible. Electrical systems are displayed by how the flow of current
				 can affect mechanical machines such as motors or pneumatic. The teaching
				 of these is to prepare students for the Robotics Competition, and
				 eventually, for their career in the STEM fields.
				 Another major goal of team 2797 is to focus our personal on giving
				 back to the community. We volunteer for Sommer Sports, and various
				 other races to keep our voice heard in the Local community in and
				 around Clermont. Otherwise, we assist in helping local elementary
				 and middle schools start and maintain their own robotics teams, to
				 further the reach of STEM in early education. We hope that by spreading
				 the reach of our robotics team, that the community will take more
				 interest in STEM programs, and help spread the importance of STEM into
				 our future Engineers, Scientists, and Mathematicians.
				 Altogether, our robotics team aims to focus its goals on creating a
				 fun and educational environment for students to learn about the merits
				 of engineering and science. Overall, we have successfully affected
				 our community, and spread our reach further than we had in past years,
				 and are now growing into something that can have a great effect on
				 the future of our generation.

        <h1>About FIRST</h1>
        <p>
          FIRST stands for, For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology,
			 it was founded toinspire the interest of students and encourage the
			 participation in science and technology activities. The goal of FIRST
			 is to impact students by engaging them in programs to build science and
			 technology skills to become well-rounded students, enhancing their
			 self-confidence, problem solving skills, and presentation skills.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <em>
          "FIRST is more than just robots. The robots are a vehicle for students
			 to learn important life skills. Kids often come in not knowing what to
			 expect – of the program nor of themselves. They leave, even after the
			 first season, with a vision, with confidence, and with a sense that they
			 can create their own future."
          </em>

        </p>
        <p>
          FIRST focuses on sparking the minds of students in science and technology
			 while preparing them with life skills. FIRST has two core values, Gracious
			 Professionalism (GP) and Coopertition. GP encourages high quality work,
			 emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals throughout the
			 competition. Coopertition is displaying unqualified kindness and respect
			 in the face of fierce competition. These two values are combined together
			 to create the balance of competition, teamwork and fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          The founder, Dean Kamen, believes strongly that the students involved
			 with FIRST are the future problem solvers and innovators and that is why
			 he created FIRST. FIRST participation is proven to encourage students
			 to pursue education and careers in STEM-related fields, inspire them to
			 become leaders and innovators, and enhance their 21st century work-life
			 skills.

        <h1>About Our Teams</h1>
        <h3>Mechanical</h3>
        <p>
         The mechanical branch focuses on the physical aspects of the robot, it’s
			structure, it’s moving parts, and it’s maintenance. Overall, the mechanical
			team educates new members on the usage of pneumatics, motors, and gearboxes,
			along with other basic mechanics and tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those members which focus themselves on the mechanical branch will learn
				the importance of tools, from digital to physical. The mechanical branch
				utilizes a program called Solidworks to plan out large scale projects,
				and complicated designs. Solidworks is a 3D Computer Aided Design software
				which allows it’s users to form complex assemblies with moving parts
				and test their feasibility in the real world. However, only learning
				concepts is not the only goal of the mechanical branch. Thus, the
				mechanical branch also utilizes tools, from screwdrivers and wrenches
				to bandsaws and drill-presses. The new members are taught the safe way
				to use these tools, and are then trained to use them for the build season.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mechanical branch is headed by the Mechanical Lead, who focuses on
				the development of the bot, and has to work together in conjunction
				with the Electronics Lead. The Mechanical Lead is tasked with guiding
				new members into the world of motors and struts. They must understand
				the basics of all of the components of the bot, including the dimensions
				of those electronics necessary for the functioning of the bot.
        </p>
        <h3>Electrical/Programming</h3>
        <p>
          The electronics Branch is separated into two departments, programming,
			 and it’s namesake, electrical. These departments are closely intertwined,
			 as one cannot function without the other, and they must work together
			 to form the input and output of the robot.
        </p>
        <p>
            The programming department focuses on the development of the coding
				for the robot. The programming languages have shifted from year to year,
				from C++, to Java, to C. This is a result of different programmers
				being comfortable using different languages. However, overall, our team
				usually falls back to Java coding, as it is among the easiest to learn,
				and usually runs well at competitions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The electronics department focuses on wiring and the more physical
				aspects of electronics. This includes the components such as the Robo-Rio,
				or motor controllers such as Talons. Wire management is an important
				aspect of electronics, because wires can get in the way of mechanical
				systems, or waste potentially usable room on the robot. Understanding
				the importance of soldering correctly, or connecting the correct
				controllers to their appropriate ports can be the difference between
				a working robot, and a robot that fries itself. This means that the
				electronics branch has to be extremely careful when working both on
				and off of the robot. Teaching how to use wires and motor controllers
				correctly are high priority for the electronics department.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Electrical Lead has to maintain the communications between the two
				departments, understand the basics of electrical systems, and keep up
				to date on the mechanical systems of the mechanical branch. They must
				also help teach new members the basic electrical systems, and wiring
				techniques, along with establishing a community between the electrical
				and programming departments.
        </p>
