        <h1>Competitions</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            Most FIRST competitions consist of two opposing alliances each made up of three randomly selected teams whose goal is to score more points than the opposing alliance. The goal of the game ranges from year to year. The Autonomous Period (each robot must operate without input) of the competition takes place over the first 15 seconds of each match, followed by the TeleOperated Period, when student drivers take control of their bots for the remaining 2 minutes and 15 seconds. Tasks completed in the Autonomous Period are worth more points than when completed during the TeleOperated Period. Since in the 2015 competition, these games  have taken on themes ranging from recycling to steampunk. In most of these competitions, the alliances are able to interact with one another in order to defend their own goals or to work together to achieve a separate task, to score additional “coopertition” points.

            <h3>2016 - Stronghold</h3>
              <h6>
                  The Challenge
              </h6>
              <p>
                  The challenge in Stronghold was centered around its medieval theme. The goal of each alliance was to cross over “defences” such as drawbridges, moats, and rock walls. Points could be scored each time a defence was “damaged” (crossed over) and when four defences were damaged twice, for “breach” points. Additional points could be scored by bringing “boulders” (foam balls) across the defences and launching them into the towers’ high goal for 5 points or depositing them into the low goals at the base of the tower for 2 points. If eight boulders entered the tower, the alliance receives additional points. At the end of the match, robots may scale or park at the base of the opposing alliances’ tower for additional bonus points. Over the course of the match, one alliance member may remain in their own side to act as a defender to prevent the other alliance from scoring in the tower.

                  Sir Strongington
              </h6>
              <!--ADD PICTURE RIGHT HERE-->
              <p>
                  Sir Strongington uses a pair of horizontally mounted wheels to suck boulders into the main arm, which also functions as a manipulator to help it cross over the defences. The arm is connected to a pair of pneumatic cylinders that allows it to move up and down. The robot uses a tank-drive styled drive train to allow it to gain traction when moving over the terrain-based obstacles and to be able to maintain its grip on the field when defending against other robots.

            <h3>2015 - Recycle Rush</h3>
              <h6>
                  The Challenge
              </h6>
              <p>
                  Contrary to most years’ games, the opposing alliances in Recycle Rush had virtually no interaction with one another. The goal of this year’s game was to create as many stacks of up to six “totes” (boxes), capped with a large recycling bin containing a pool noodle on top of the designated platforms. Each tote was worth 2 points, and the recycling bin acted as a point multiplier for each stack. Totes could be taken either from the “landfill” (mix of totes arranged in different directions and orientations) or from the feeding station adjacent to drivers’ station. Additional coopertition points could be scored if each alliance contributed to a stack of 4 totes on top of a raised central platform.

              <h6>
                  Sir Lift-A-Lot
              </h6>
              <p>
                  Sir Lift-A-Lot uses a pair of CIM motors to drive a basic winch to move the lifting mechanism up and down. This lifting mechanism is made of a custom-designed hook used to interface with every side of the totes. The hook is mounted on extruded aluminum sliders supported by diagonal braces. The nanotube (gearbox)-driven mecanum wheels allows the robot to move forward, backward, and laterally without turning. This made it easier to adjust on the field while building a stack.

            <h3>2014 - Aerial Assist</h3>
              <h6>
                  The Challenge
              </h6>
              <p>
                  In Aerial Assist, each alliance was provided with a two-foot exercise ball, with the goal of the taking the ball to the opposite side of the field, where it could be launched into the high goal for ten points or deposited into the low goal for 2 points. Additional points were able to be scored if the ball was passed between alliance members. Alliances could earn more points if the ball was launched over the “truss” (bar placed 5 feet in the air spanning the entire field) and even more if the ball was caught on the other side without touching the ground. One team member of each alliance could be deemed the “defending bot”, whose job was to either block their own alliance’s goals or to try to interrupt the opposing alliance’s ball as it was being passed between players.

                  Sir Icarus
              </h6>
              <p>
                  Sir Icarus was one of our  most pneumatic-intensive robots, using two pairs of pneumatic cylinders to create a two-stage lifter. The “down” stage allows the ball to be grabbed by the rollers lining the top of the lifting mechanism. The “up” stage primes the robot to be able to launch the ball using a kicking mechanism. Sir Icarus also uses a tank-drive styled drive train, using three wheels on each side. This allows the robot to move quickly and to be able to stand up against other robots that may attempt to push it.
