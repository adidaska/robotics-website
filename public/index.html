			<h1>Our Mission</h1>
			<blockquote>
				"I feel like I am at home, but I know I am making a difference"<br>
				- Rishi Basdeo, President
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Established in 2009, the East Ridge High School Knight and Nerdy Robotics
				team has held steadfast amongst its peers in the FIRST Robotics Competition.
				First Sponsored by Rick Croteau, it has shifted to Justin King as the
				head teacher of the team. The team has been working hard in the past
				7 years to have an impact not only on FIRST, but on it’s community as
				well.

					<h3>Mechanical</h3>
					<p>
						The mechanical branch focuses on the physical aspects of the
						robot, it’s structure, it’s moving parts, and it’s maintenance.
						Overall, the mechanical team educates new members on the usage
						of pneumatics, motors, and gearboxes, along with other basic
						mechanics and tools.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="programming">
					<h3>Electrical/Programming</h3>
					<p>
						The electronics Branch is separated into two departments, programming
						and it’s namesake, electrical. These departments are closely intertwined,
						as one cannot function without the other, and they must work together
						to form the input and output of the robot.

				<h1>In Competition</h1>
				<blockquote>
					"It's fun to learn, but it's more fun to win"<br>
					- Alex Vila, Vice President
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					FIRST focuses on sparking the minds of students in science and technology
					while preparing them with life skills. FIRST has two core values, GraciouS
					Professionalism (GP) and Coopertition. GP encourages high quality work,
					emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals throughout the
					competition. Coopertition is displaying unqualified kindness and respect
					in the face of fierce competition. These two values are combined together
					to create the balance of competition, teamwork and fun.
